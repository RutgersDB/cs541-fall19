<h1>541: Database System Implementation</h1>
</div>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This course is designed to introduce graduate students to some advanced topics in data management, including data curation and data integration. This is not a course on database design or SQL programming. It is designed for students who have taken data structure and algorithm courses; no prior database experience is assumed though students who have taken an undergraduate course in databases are encouraged to attend.</p>
<p>Classes will consist of lectures and discussions based on readings from the data management literature. For 6.830, there will be programming assignments (in C<tt></tt>), paper review and presentation, and a semester long project. </p>
<p>Enrollment may be limited.</p>
<p>The course web site is XXXX.</p>
<h2>Lectures</h2>
<p>Lectures are held once a week, from 12:00pm-3:00pm in CCB 1209 on Thursday. Attendance at lectures is mandatory and you are expected to show up prepared to answer questions and participate in discussion.</p>
<p>Topics Covered</p>
<p>Topics related to data curation, including: data integration, data cleaning, data wrangling, and data visualization. Lecture and readings from original research papers.</p>
<p>Prerequisites</p>
<p>Students should have taken XXXXX (DS and ALGO) or equivalent. If you do not have experience in these subjects and would like to take the course, please email the instructor. Prior database experience is not required. C<tt></tt> programming experience is assumed.</p>
<h2>Grading</h2>
<p>Grades are assigned based on programming assignments, paper review and presentation, final project, and class participation. The grading breakdown is as follows:</p>
<p>Assignment: 30<tt> total
Paper Review and Presentation: 30</tt> each
Final Project: 30<tt>
Class Participation: 10</tt></p>
<p>Each student is allowed 5 &ldquo;late days&rdquo;, each of which may be used to turn in one problem set or lab one day (24 hour period) later than it is due without penalty. After all five late days are used, assignments will be docked one letter grade for each day they are late.</p>
<p>Late days may not be used for the final project/lab 6 or exams. Regardless of late days, problem sets must be handed in before problem set solutions are posted, usually a week after the problem set is due.</p>
<h2>Collaboration Policy</h2>
<p>For problem sets and labs, you are allowed to discuss your answers with other students, but please write up your own answers and list your collaborators. Copying solutions from other students is never allowed. For the group project you will work in teams and hand in only one written report. Note that we will use software to detect copying of lab and homework assignments.</p>
<h2>Text</h2>
<p>The course readings will primarily be drawn from the 4th Edition of &lsquo;&lsquo;Readings in Database Systems&rsquo;&rsquo;, edited by Stonebraker and Hellerstein.</p>
<p>Both texts are available from the MIT Coop. Note that the 3rd Edition of &ldquo;Readings In Database Systems&rdquo; is a substantially different text (it does not include the same readings as the 4th edition, or the recently released 5th edition.) Also, note that &ldquo;Readings in Database Systems&rdquo; is available online from Books 24x7.com (free registration is required, and you may need to authenticate with the MIT Libraries or log in to library.books24x7.com.libproxy.mit.edu and search &ndash; this URL was updated 8<i>30</i>2017).</p>
<h2>Supplemental Readings</h2>
<p>There will be several other readings that will be posted on the course web site.</p>
